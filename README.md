# Methods in Genomics

## Basic genomic toolkit

 - Gene set Enrichment Analysis
 - Protein-protein interaction DBs and tools
 - Detection/prediction of TF binding sites
 
## NGS

 - RNA-seq
 - ChIP-seq
 - Hi-C / Capture-C
 
## GWAS

 - General overview, key concepts
 - Databases and tools

## Data analysis

 - Data exploration one-o'-one
 - Simple correlation line
 - Data clustering
 
## Big data solutions

 - Tools for huge data manipulation (huge matrices, dataframes...)
 
## Data visualization

- Plots you must know about

## Evolution

 - Sequence alignment and visaulization
 - Phylogenomics
 - Hypothesis testing (detection of positive selection)
