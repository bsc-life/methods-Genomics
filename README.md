# Methods in Genomics

### How this works:
 - inside the Topics folder are organized the topics we are going to touch, if you start with a new topic checkout the [GSEA](Topics/Genomic_toolkits/GSEA) example (no need to do tutorial & presenation & bibliography, this is just an example).
 - bellow are listed the main topics we would like to cover (suggestions welcome)
 - in the [issues](https://github.com/bsc-life/methods-Genomics/issues) section of this page are listed again the topics (each issue is a topic), grouped by fields (as labels). This issues section could be great to quickly see who knows what. **If you know about a given topic please assign yourself to the corresponding issue**.
   - *Github trick: if you add files to the repo related to a given topic (e.g. GSEA), you can search for the issue number in "issues" and add this number to your commit message (`commit -am "added presentation to GSEA related to #1"`), this will automatically link your commit, and thus your changes, to the corresponding issue ([more info](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue))*

that's it!



## Bioinformatics tools and methods

### Basic genomic toolkit

 - Gene set Enrichment Analysis
 - Protein-protein interaction DBs and tools
 - Detection/prediction of TF binding sites
 
### NGS

 - RNA-seq
 - ChIP-seq
 - Hi-C / Capture-C

### GWAS

 - General overview, key concepts
 - Databases and tools
 
### Protein structure

 - Linking DNA to protein structure (visualization and analysis)

## Data analysis
 

### What to do with data

 - Data exploration one-o'-one
 - Simple correlation line
 - Data clustering
 
### Big data solutions

 - Tools for huge data manipulation (huge matrices, dataframes...)
 
### Data visualization

- Plots you must know about

## Evolution

 - Sequence alignment and visaulization
 - Phylogenomics
 - Hypothesis testing (detection of positive selection)
