# Methods in Genomics

How this works:
 - inside the Topics folder are organized the topics we are going to touch, if you start with a new topic checkout the [GSEA](Topics/Genomic_toolkits/GSEA) example (no need to do tutorial & presenation & bibliography, this is just an example).
 - bellow are listed the main topics we would like to cover (suggestions welcome)
 - in the issues section of this page are listed again the topics, but as issues, grouped by fields (as labels). This issues section could be great to quickly see who knows what. If you think you know about a given topic please assign yourself to the corresponding issue.

that's it!



## Bioinformatics tools and methods

### Basic genomic toolkit

 - Gene set Enrichment Analysis
 - Protein-protein interaction DBs and tools
 - Detection/prediction of TF binding sites
 
### NGS

 - RNA-seq
 - ChIP-seq
 - Hi-C / Capture-C

### GWAS

 - General overview, key concepts
 - Databases and tools
 
### Protein structure

 - Linking DNA to protein structure (visualization and analysis)

## Data analysis
 

### What to do with data

 - Data exploration one-o'-one
 - Simple correlation line
 - Data clustering
 
### Big data solutions

 - Tools for huge data manipulation (huge matrices, dataframes...)
 
### Data visualization

- Plots you must know about

## Evolution

 - Sequence alignment and visaulization
 - Phylogenomics
 - Hypothesis testing (detection of positive selection)
