# Methods in Genomics

## Bioinformatics tools and methods

### Basic genomic toolkit

 - Gene set Enrichment Analysis
 - Protein-protein interaction DBs and tools
 - Detection/prediction of TF binding sites
 
### NGS

 - RNA-seq
 - ChIP-seq
 - Hi-C / Capture-C

### GWAS

 - General overview, key concepts
 - Databases and tools
 
### Protein structure

 - Linking DNA to protein structure (visualization and analysis)

## Data analysis
 

### What to do with data

 - Data exploration one-o'-one
 - Simple correlation line
 - Data clustering
 
### Big data solutions

 - Tools for huge data manipulation (huge matrices, dataframes...)
 
### Data visualization

- Plots you must know about

## Evolution

 - Sequence alignment and visaulization
 - Phylogenomics
 - Hypothesis testing (detection of positive selection)
