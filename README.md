# Methods in Genomics

### How this works:

 - inside the Topics folder are organized the topics we are going to touch, if you start with a new topic checkout the [GSEA](Topics/Genomic_toolkits/GSEA) example (no need to do tutorial & presenation & bibliography, this is just an example).
 - bellow are listed the main topics we would like to cover (suggestions welcome)
 - in the [issues](https://github.com/bsc-life/methods-Genomics/issues) section of this page are listed again the topics (each issue is a topic), grouped by fields (as labels). This issues section could be great to quickly see who knows what. **If you know about a given topic please assign yourself to the corresponding issue**.
   - *Github trick: if you add files to the repo related to a given topic (e.g. GSEA), you can search for the issue number in "issues" and add this number to your commit message (`commit -am "added presentation to GSEA related to #1"`), this will automatically link your commit, and thus your changes, to the corresponding issue ([more info](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue))*


that's it!
